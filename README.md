# Rpg
Random little thing done with chat gpt in about an hour

Basicaly nothing but a core of a very simple game where you gather ressources with space, move with zqsd (yep french keyboard sorry for that)
Unoptimized as shit running with a dict for the map with unfinished idea in the code like chunks of block for loading and unloading areas and not singular blocks.

Basicaly just here for me
